> when we talk about managing state, we are referring to the data you need in order to rebuild your UI at any moment in time. 

> The state that is local to any widget is known as ephemeral state (sometimes also called UI state). As the state is contained within a single widget, there is no need for any complex state management techniques â€“ just using a simple StatefulWidget to rebuild the UI is enough.

> The state that is shared across different widgets is known as the app state (sometimes also called shared state). This is where state management solutions help a lot.
